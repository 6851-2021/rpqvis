# rpqvis: Retroactive Priority Queue Visualization

This project implements a visualization of (fully) **retroactive priority
queues** (as described in
[6.851 Lecture 2](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.851/spring21/lectures/L02.html)
and
[this paper by Demaine, Iacono, and Langerman](http://erikdemaine.org/papers/Retroactive_TALG/)).
Specifically, the visualization shows the geometric interpretation where:

* The x axis represents time
* The y axis represents key values
* Insertions are represented by rightward rays
* Delete-mins are represented by upward rays

The implementation is meant to be illustrative, and is not efficient as a
data structure.  (It spends linear time per operation.)

## Usage

* Open `vis.py` in Python 3 (with tkinter installed)
* Click the Help button for a basic overview of functionality
